Hey, let's talk in the first person!
I work with quality people to bring out exciting solutions and learn new technologies!

If you're free and have something that we could have a coffee over, please feel free to ping me, I'd love to meet you in person😃

Now, if you're looking for my tech side,
I spend time architecting and building designs, cross-platform applications, performant web apps, and more!.

-   📭 [Reach out](#hi-there-samujjwaal-here) for help with Web and other interesting stuff.
-   💬 Talk to me about if Earth actually is flat, would headlights work at light speed, and everything in between
-   👾 Fun fact: Everything that has been or could be written/said already exists in the [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/)
